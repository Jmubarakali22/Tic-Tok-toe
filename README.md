# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic game in Python.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns placing their "X" or "O" on an empty spot.
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. The game ends when there is a winner or the board is full, resulting in a draw.
